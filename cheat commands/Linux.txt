How do you list the files and directories ?
ls - list the files and directories
ls -l -- to list the files and directories in long format 
ls -lt -- to list the files and directories in long format with time 
ls -lrt -- To list the files and directories in long format with reverse of time 
pwd -- Present working directory 
touch -- is used to create empty file 
mkdir -- is used to create a directory
cd -- is used to change directory
cd .. -- to come out of present directory
cd ../.. -- if you want to come out of 2 or more directories
cd -  acts as recall between last 2 commands 
ls -a -- to list the hidden files and directories
ls -al -- to list the hidden files and directories in long format 
cat -- used to display the content of a file on the screen 
vi -- is used to edit a file via vi editor
	-- Esc i -- used to insert mode in vi editor
	-- Esc:wq! -- used to save and quit the file --- w - write q - quit ! - forcefully 
	-- Esc:q! -- quit without saving the content 
	-- Esc:set number -- which sets the number for a file 
	-- Esc:setnonumber -- which removes the number for a file 
	Replace a string in the editor
	syntax: Esc:%s/string1/string2/g
		- s stands for substitute and g stands for globally 
	Examples : Esc:1s/string1/string2/g -- changes in 1st line only 
	Esc:1,5 s/string1/string2/g -- changes from 1st to 5th line 
	Esc: 7,$ s/string1/string2/g -- changes from 7th line end of file 
	esc: 1 s/string1/string2/1 -- changes in 1s line 1st occurance only 
-- Search a pattern /string 
Esc :/ pattern  -- it will move to 1st occurance then keep pressing n to 2nd and so on 

-- How do you delete the whole line in editor 
Esc dd

or 
egrep can be used instead of -e everywhere 
grep -w "linux" filename --- to search only a perticular word 
grep -v "linux" filename --- To print the lines except the lines which have a linux word 
grep -c : to count the lines if the pattern is present

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Links : There are two typs lins 1. Soft links and 2. hard links 
-- Soft links or Symbolic links or synm links : I is a shortcut to a file, if i modfy actual file it will get reflected in a link also and if i delete the original file or actual file soft link will not work 
syn: ln -s filename linkname 

Hard Links: it is also a shortcut to a file, if i delete the original file hard link will work because it points to inode of file ( inode is a unique identification number which indicates memory address of a file )
syn : ln filename linkname 

how do add user in linux 
command useradd <username> -- to add user

how to login as a root 
commands 
sudo su 
sudo bash 
su -
su root 

ssh ---
it used to login to remote server
syntax: ssh user@server2 -- to login from server 1 to server2


To enable passwrd authentication / public key authentication follow the steps 

--- vi /etc/ssh/sshd_config
uncomment or chnage it to yes the followng line 
PubkeyAuthentication yes
uncomment or chnage it to yes --- PasswordAuthentication yes
save it -- wq!
restart ssh service --- systemctl restart sshd

rsync: it is used to copy files from one server to anoter and also within the server while copying the data if copy is stopped dueto network issue in between,  if i use scp it will start copying from begining and if i use rsync u will start copying from where it is stopped 
syntax : rsync filename user@server2:path

Note: Itwill sync to the destnation from source it is not reversible 
To reverse we have to login to server 2 and give the same command 

Q) What is the difference between rsync and scp 
while copying the files from one server to another server, if copying stopped in between due to network problem, once the system is back online if you re issue the command scp will start from the begining ut rsync will start copying from where it stopped 

Ping: It is used to check whether the server is up and running 
syntax : ping <serverip or address>
telnet : it is used t authenticate remote server account credentials

How do you setup a passwordless connection between servers?
we need to run ssh-keygen command on server1 take the public key go to server2 paste the key in authorized_keys file in .ssh folder, next time we will login it will be a passwordless connection 


Very Imp:
.bashrc is a executable for interactive non login shells that means if you have already logged into your computer open a new window then .bashrc s executed before windows command promt 
.bash profile is executed for login shells that means when login via console bash profile is executed to configure your shell before the initial command promt
